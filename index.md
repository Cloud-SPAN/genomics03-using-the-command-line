Command line interface (OS shell) and graphic user interface (GUI) are different ways of interacting with a computer's operating system. The shell is a program that presents a command line interface which allows you to control your computer using commands entered with a keyboard instead of controlling graphical user interfaces (GUIs) with a mouse/keyboard combination.

A lot of genomics analysis is done using command-line tools for three reasons:   

- you will often be working with a large number of files, and working through the command-line rather than 
through a graphical user interface (GUI) allows you to automate repetitive tasks,    
- you will often need more compute power than is available on your personal computer, and 
connecting to and interacting with remote computers requires a command-line interface, and    
- you will often need to customize your analyses, and command-line tools often enable more 
customization than the corresponding GUI tools (if in fact a GUI tool even exists).   


> ## Getting Started
>
> This lesson assumes no prior experience with the tools covered in the course. 
> However, learners are expected to have some familiarity with biological concepts,
> including the 
> concept of genomic variation within a population. Participants should bring their laptops and plan to participate actively. 
>
> This lesson is part of a course that uses data hosted on an Amazon Machine Instance (AMI). Course participants will be given 
> information on how
> to log-in to the AMI during the course. Information on preparing for the course is provided on the [Cloud-SPAN Genomics Course setup page](https://cloud-span.github.io/genomics01-intro/setup.html).
