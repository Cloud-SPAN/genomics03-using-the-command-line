Cloud-SPAN is a collaboration between the [University of York](https://www.york.ac.uk/) and [The Software Sustainability Institute](https://www.software.ac.uk/) funded by the [UKRI Innovation Scholars award](https://www.ukri.org/news/initiatives-boost-health-and-bioscience-skills-and-industry/). Project Reference: [MR/V038680/1](https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=MR%2FV038680%2F1).

Cloud-SPAN trains researchers, and the research software engineers that support them, to run specialised analyses on cloud-based high-performance computing infrastructure. We are developing highly accessible resources which integrate with existing Carpentries courses.

This set of lessons is based on a [Data Carpentries Genomics Workshop](https://datacarpentry.org/genomics-workshop/).
